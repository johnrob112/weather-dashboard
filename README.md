# weather-dashboard


For this project I was tasked to create a weather dashboard.  For this project I was able to use code from my Tourism-App project, as much of it was crossover.  During the time of the original due date, we were starting to work on the group project so I shifted my focus there, knowing that the similar code would be used to submit this one.
